# Choice of Law {.unnumbered}

1. Neff (CA) visits Oregon and is astonished to find a house on a parcel of land that Neff had purchased some years earlier from Mitchell (WA). After some investigation, Neff learns that the house was built and is currently occupied by Pennoyer (OR), who claims to have purchased the land from Mitchell. Neff brings a quiet title action in federal court against Pennoyer, seeking a declaratory judgment that Neff is the sole rightful owner of the property, which is valued at $100,000. Under state law, Pennoyer may, in the same action, assert his own claim (a "third-party claim") against Mitchell to recover $80,000 for breach of contract & fraud in the event the court decides the quiet title claim in favor of Neff. Under federal law, specifically Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Pennoyer may not assert this type of third-party claim; instead he would have to bring a separate action against Mitchell following the outcome of the quiet title suit. Which law should the federal court apply to each issue? 

a. State law, because it is in direct conflict with federal law. 

b. FRCP Rule 14, if the court determines that it advances an important federal interest. 

c. FRCP Rule 14, regardless of the rationale behind it. 

d. Whichever the court determines is most equitable and efficient.  

2. In which of the following instances must a federal court apply state law, rather than federal law, in a diversity case)? 

a. Under state law, a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must prove _both_ that it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied _and_ that this harm outweighs any harm to the defendant if the injunction is granted. In federal court, the plaintiff has the burden of it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; the defendant then has the burden of proving it will suffer greater harm if the injunction is granted. 

b. Under state law, a plaintiff asserting a claim for breach of a written contract must attach a copy of the contract to the complaint. FRCP Rule 8 merely requires that the complaint contain "a short and plain statement of the claim"; production of the written contract happens during the discovery process under FRCP Rule 26 and 34. 

c. Under state law, before a civil suit may proceed to trial, the parties must participate in a court-supervised mediation process. Under federal law, mediation is voluntary and requires the agreement of all parties. 

d. All of the above.
