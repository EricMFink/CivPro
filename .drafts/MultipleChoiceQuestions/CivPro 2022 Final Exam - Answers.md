# Part I: Essay

1.  PreGame, LLC (a North Carolina company headquartered in Greensboro, NC) hosts, staffs, and promotes events for professional and collegiate sports fans. PreGame contracts with collegiate and professional sports teams for the right to host and staff special events, including tailgate parties. PreGame grants sponsorship rights to vendors looking to promote their brands at these events.
    
2.  TeamSpirit, LLC (a South Carolina company headquartered in Columbia, SC) markets, distributes, and sells vodka and related products. TeamSpirit has licensing agreements and partnerships with collegiate and professional sports teams in South Carolina, Texas, Florida, Tennessee, New York, Louisiana, Maryland, and Colorado. TeamSpirit does not have any partnerships, licensing agreements, affiliations, or agreements with any college or professional sports teams in North Carolina. TeamSpirit is not registered to do business in North Carolina, does not have a license to sell liquor in North Carolina, and does not maintain any physical location or own real property in North Carolina.
    
3.  PreGame’s Director of Business Development, Greg Green (“Green”) initiated contact with TeamSpirit after seeing TeamSpirit Vodka billboards in Tampa, Florida while traveling there for the Super Bowl. Green sent an email to Carol Coral (“Coral”), TeamSpirit’s Chief Sales Officer, saying that PreGame’s services “might be a great way for TeamSpirit to be a part of our platform and drive additional sales at game days across America. Would love to discuss further if interested.”
    
4.  Coral replied with an e-mail to Green, providing information about TeamSpirit’s business and explaining that the company was “deep into the planning process of a rather disruptive 2021 TeamSpirit Tailgate Tour that’ll run throughout FL, GA, SC, TX, LA, CO, MD, & numerous other markets.”
    
5.  In February 2021, PreGame employee Mal Mundy (“Mundy”) engaged in exploratory discussions with TeamSpirit employees Coral, Sandy Snow (“Snow”), and Ray Rudolph (“Rudolph”) regarding a potential relationship between PreGame and TeamSpirit. All negotiations between PreGame and TeamSpirit took place remotely via phone calls and videoconferences.
    
6.  In early March 2021, Coral sent Mundy a 30-page presentation (the “TeamSpirit Pitch Deck”) created by TeamSpirit, which discussed a potential marketing partnership between PreGame and TeamSpirit.
    
7.  The TeamSpirit Pitch Deck included a “Distribution Roadmap”, containing a list of U.S. markets in which TeamSpirit intended to begin distributing its vodka. North Carolina is the first state TeamSpirit listed for the year 2022.
    
8.  The TeamSpirit Pitch Deck also included a “Partnership Roadmap”, containing a list of collegiate and professional sports organizations with which TeamSpirit sought to establish partnerships during each year from 2021–23. Demonic University, located in North Carolina, is listed as a partner for the year 2023.
    
9.  In late March 2021, Mundy participated in a videoconference with Coral and Rudolph, during which Mundy presented PreGame’s proposal for a marketing agreement with TeamSpirit (the “March Zoom Call”). Mundy, a resident of Michigan, was in Charlotte, North Carolina during the March Zoom Call, because he was involved in one of PreGame’s events taking place at Charlotte’s Bank of America Stadium. During the March Zoom Call, Mundy presented a pitch deck prepared by PreGame to TeamSpirit representatives.
    
10. The PreGame Pitch Deck contains a map of PreGame’s existing collegiate and professional sports partnerships, including three universities in North Carolina. During the presentation, Coral indicated to Mundy that TeamSpirit wished to expand into North Carolina.
    
11. Following the March Zoom Call, PreGame and TeamSpirit, with the assistance of legal counsel, exchanged drafts of a proposed written marketing agreement.
    
12. In May 2021, the parties finalized the terms of a written marketing agreement (the “Agreement”), which was signed by Mundy on behalf of PreGame and by Dan Daniels on behalf of TeamSpirit. The Agreement was executed by use of DocuSign, and none of the signatories were located in North Carolina at the time of execution.
    
13. The Agreement, in its opening paragraph, identifies PreGame as a North Carolina limited liability company.
    
14. The Agreement commenced on 20 May 2021 and is set to expire on 30 June 2025.
    
15. The Agreement states that “\[t\]his Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without application of its conflicts of laws provisions.”
    
16. The Agreement requires TeamSpirit to make periodic payments to PreGame. TeamSpirit is to “submit each payment by check or wire transfer. If TeamSpirit pays by check, then TeamSpirit should send the check, together with an invoice identifying this Agreement, to the remittance address identified below, unless and until PreGame directs otherwise.” The remittance address given in the Agreement is PreGame’s company headquarters in Greensboro, North Carolina.
    
17. Under the Agreement, PreGame is to develop and oversee tailgate parties at sporting events featuring TeamSpirit products. As a part of its performance under the Agreement, “PreGame is responsible for providing, transporting, maintaining, setting up, taking down and replacing all equipment and physical assets used at Events and that are used to provide Marketing Activities.”
    
18. TeamSpirit is to make scheduled payments to PreGame. In addition, the Agreement requires that TeamSpirit and PreGame enter into written Work Orders, which set forth “the scope and value of the Marketing Activities to be provided by PreGame to TeamSpirit.” A Work Order form is attached to the Agreement, and requires the title, date, location of the event, the marketing activities to take place, the value of the marketing activities, and any additional provisions related to the event. Each Work Order stated in the opening paragraph that PreGame is “a North Carolina limited liability company.”
    
19. Pursuant to the Agreement, PreGame assigned Katie Kirkland (“Kirkland”), a PreGame employee, to be a dedicated staff member to effectuate TeamSpirit’s events, marketing, and promotional activities.
    
20. Kirkland was located in Alabama at all times relevant to the Agreement, and along with Mundy, generated all Work Orders.
    
21. Kirkland was responsible for implementing activities and services described in Work Orders, including coordinating physical set-ups, third-party vendors, and catering services at events under the Agreement.
    
22. Exhibit D to the Agreement, titled “PreGame XP Properties,” includes a list of collegiate and professional sports entities with which PreGame has an existing relationship. These include three universities located in North Carolina.
    
23. No events or signed Work Orders arising out of the Agreement expressly called for hospitality services, activities or events to be performed or take place in North Carolina.
    
24. No events for which Work Orders were prepared and executed ever occurred in North Carolina.
    
25. Sandy Snow (“Snow”), TeamSpirit’s Vice President of Marketing and primary point of contact with PreGame regarding the Agreement, claims that he was never informed that any North Carolina-made product or North Carolina vendor was to be used in conjunction with the Agreement, Events, or Work Orders.
    
26. In July 2021, TeamSpirit asked Kirkland to procure a variety of branded items with TeamSpirit’s logos and designs, including drink coolers and cups, to be used at events hosted or sponsored by TeamSpirit under the Agreement. Kirkland and other PreGame employees identified Swag Solutions of Charlotte, North Carolina (“Swag”) as a vendor for these items. In August 2021, Kirkland, through email, introduced Snow to Swag employees. Snow then communicated directly with Swag employees and discussed TeamSpirit’s need for the drink coolers and cups. The Swag employees with whom Snow communicated had email signatures identifying that Swag is located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Following Snow’s direct communication with Swag, Snow and Mundy executed a Work Order authorizing the purchase of branded drink coolers and cups from Swag.
    
27. TeamSpirit also asked that PreGame obtain branded umbrellas, which PreGame sourced from Ultimate Umbrellas in Burlington, North Carolina (“Ultimate Umbrellas”) and which the parties memorialized in a Work Order.
    
28. In August 2021, Snow and Mundy executed a Work Order for the design and purchase by PreGame of branded canvas tent tops for TeamSpirit to use at events it intended to sponsor under the Agreement. One of the tent tops was co-branded with TeamSpirit and the University of South Carolina. PreGame does not have a warehouse in South Carolina and requested that the University of South Carolina tent top be delivered to PreGame in Greensboro, North Carolina instead. Upon receipt of the tent top in Greensboro, PreGame shipped the tent top from Greensboro to a third-party tent company in South Carolina for future use at events in that state. The Work Order indicates that the University of South Carolina tent top was to be shipped to Greensboro, North Carolina.
    
29. In October 2021, TeamSpirit published a variety of images and written material on its website and social media pages in honor of National Coaches’ Day, writing that “we wanted to highlight some of the most impactful coaches from some of our partners.” Mack Diabelski, men’s basketball coach at Demonic University in North Carolina, is the first coach listed and profiled on TeamSpirit’s webpage.
    
30. TeamSpirit made the first four scheduled payments to PreGame under the Agreement. PreGame billed TeamSpirit by submitting invoices directing TeamSpirit to submit payment to PreGame in Greensboro. TeamSpirit paid each of these invoices by wire transfer from TeamSpirit’s account at a bank in South Carolina to PreGame’s account at a bank in Greensboro.
    
31. In December 2021, TeamSpirit sent a letter by registered mail to PreGame’s Greensboro, North Carolina address, notifying PreGame that TeamSpirit intended to terminate the Agreement effective immediately. The letter also stated that TeamSpirit would not pay any further invoices, including the December 2021 invoice in the amount of $250,000.
    
32. After receiving the letter, PreGame sued TeamSpirit for breach of contract in North Carolina state court.
    

## Question

Does the court have personal jurisdiction over the defendant?

### Model Answer 

_Rule_

Under the “minimum contacts” standard for personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, the focus is on whether the defendant’s contacts with the forum state are sufficient that requiring the defendant to litigate in that state would not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice”. If so, and if the suit arises out of those contacts, there is a presumption in favor of jurisdiction. The burden then shifts to the defendant to overcome that presumption, by identifying special circumstances that would make jurisdiction unreasonable despite the contacts.

The relevant contacts are based on the defendant’s own voluntary acts in or directed at the forum state. These may include activity within the forum state, or acts outside the forum state by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the legal, economic, or other benefits or protections of the forum state. In contrast, independent acts by the plaintiff or others will not establish contacts by the defendant, nor will the defendant's mere acquiescence in the plaintiff's unilateral forum-state activity. 

The minimum contacts requirement may be satisfied when an out-of-state defendant contracts with an in-state plaintiff to provide goods or services in the forum state. For example, in McGee, an Arizona insurance company issued a policy to a California resident, and then periodically communicated with the policyholder in California pursuant to the contract. Similarly, in Burger King, the Michigan defendants entered into a franchise contract with Burger King in Florida, attended Burger King training in Florida, and periodically communicated with Burger King in Florida pursuant to the contract. In each case, the Court held that, by voluntarily establishing a contractual relationship with a party in the forum state, and by ongoing communications and activities pursuant to the contract directed to the party in the forum state, the defendants in these cases had established contacts with the forum state, and were thus within the reach of personal jurisdiction in suits arising from the their alleged breach of the contract. 

A strict causal relationship between the defendant's forum state activity and the cause of action is not necessarily required. Activity evidencing the defendant's intent to take advantage of the market for the defendant's goods or services within the state, such as advertising and establishing sales or service outlets there, may support personal jurisdiction, even if the defendant's alleged wrongful conduct occurred outside the state. (Ford Motor Co. v. Montana). 

If the minimum contacts requirement is satisfied, the court may nonetheless decline to exercise jurisdiction if it would be unreasonable, based on these factors: (1) a special burden on the defendant (beyond the ordinary burden of having to defend a case in another state), (2) the plaintiff’s interest in litigating the matter in the forum state, (3) the forum state’s interest in the litigation, (4) the judicial system’s interest in efficient resolution of disputes, and (5) the competing policy interests of other states (or foreign jurisdictions).

_Analysis_

The lawsuit here arises out of a contract between a NC plaintiff and a SC defendant. Thus, the analysis turns on what, if anything, the defendant did in or aimed at NC in connection with the contractual relationship. 

TeamSpirit will argue that the breach of contract claim does not arise out of anything the company did in or aimed at NC. It does not have any licensing agreement or partnerships dealings or agreements with any sports teams in North Carolina, it is not registered to do business in North Carolina, it does not have a license to sell liquor in North Carolina, and it does not maintain any physical location or own real property in North Carolina. Negotiations leading to the contract with PreGame took place outside NC. Most significantly, none of the Work Orders under the Agreement expressly called for hospitality services, activities or events to be performed or take place in North Carolina. Finally, TeamSpirit will argue that any connection to NC---the fact that PreGame has its business headquarters in NC; the contractual requirement that TeamSpirit remit payment by mail to PreGame's NC address or by wire transfer to a NC bank; the sourcing of coolers, cups, and umbrellas from NC vendors and the delivery of tent tops to NC---represent merely TeamSpirit's acquiescence in PreGame's own contacts with the state. 

In contrast, PreGame will argue that the parties' course of dealing entails ample contacts between TeamSpirit and NC to support personal jurisdiction. First, even though none of the events under the contract, prior to TeamSpirit's breach, took place in NC, they did involve the purchase and delivery of goods in NC. These purchases and deliveries did not result from PreGame's unilateral choices, but rather were the subject of communication and agreement between the parties, for their mutual benefit under the contract. This case is thus distinguishable from World Wide Volkswagen, where the plaintiff unilaterally chose to drive the car through Oklahoma, without any encouragement from or benefit to the NY car dealership. Moreover, there is evidence here that TeamSpirit entered into the agreement with PreGame in furtherance of its intent to extend its business into North Carolina. TeamSpirit's "Pitch Deck" explicitly identified plans to begin selling its vodka in NC and to enter into a partnership with Demonic University, located in North Carolina, in 2022-23. This is enough to establish the requisite "relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation" (Ford Motor Co. v. Montana) for due process. 

# Part II: Short Answers

For each question in this part:

- Identify the applicable rule (i.e. FRCP or Statute), and
    
- Explain how the rule applies to the facts
    

_The following facts apply to all question in Part II: _

Parker (a citizen of North Carolina) rented a beach house in North Carolina from Dixon (a citizen of North Carolina) through an online service, EZStay (incorporated and having its principal place of business in California). When Parker made the reservation, she paid the rental fee in full, as required by EZStay’s terms of service. Upon arriving at the beach house, Parker was horrified to discover that it was infested with ants that were feasting on food scraps and dirty dishes left in the kitchen and living room. Parker immediately went to the EZStay website to cancel the reservation and request a refund of the rental fee, but the request was denied. Unwilling to spend her vacation in such disgusting conditions, Parker instead checked into a hotel, where she enjoyed a pleasant and ant-free stay, but at twice the cost of Dixon’s rental house. After returning home, Parker left a review on the EZStay website, giving Dixon 0 out of 5 stars, and saying “I wouldn’t let my worst enemy stay at this beach house. It’s in disgusting condition and the owner is an unscrupulous jerk!”

Parker sues Dixon in federal court, asserting a claim under the Truth in E-Commerce Act, a federal statute. The Act requires all goods and services sold or rented online to be fit for the ordinary and intended purpose for which they are sold or leased, and allows a consumer to sue the seller or lessor if goods or services purchased or leased online are not fit for their ordinary and intended purpose. 

In each of the following questions, assume that the court has personal jurisdiction over all parties and do not address that issue. 

## Question 1

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit (which includes the federal courts in North Carolina) has held that short-term rental properties are not “goods or services” within the meaning of the Truth in E-Commerce Act. Dixon files a motion to dismiss Parker’s complaint, asserting that under the controlling 4th Circuit precedent, Parker’s complaint does not state a valid claim under the Truth in E-Commerce Act. Dixon also moves for sanctions against Parker and her attorney, arguing that the claim has no legal basis and was filed for the improper purpose of trying to pressure Dixon to give Parker a refund.

Assuming the court agrees that, under the 4th Circuit precedent, it must dismiss the complaint, should the court also impose sanctions on Parker and/or her attorney?

### Model Answer 

_Rule:_ FRCP Rule 11. 

_Explanation:_ The mere fact that a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim is not itself grounds for sanctions under Rule 11. Rather, the defendant must specifically establish that the complaint violated one of the four requirements under Rule 11(b). Two of those requirements are relevant here: 

- Rule 11(b)(1): the complaint "is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation";
- Rule 11(b)(2): "the claims … are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law".

If a complaint asserts a colorable claim for the purpose of obtaining legally-available relief, a plaintiff does not violate Rule 11(b)(1) by pursuing a settlement (Sussman v. Bank of Israel). But asserting a legally baseless claim to induce payment that the plaintiff could not recover at trial would violate Rule 11(b)(1) (and could also amount to criminal extortion). So, Parker and her attorney are subject to sanctions under Rule 11(b)(1) only if the claim was baseless. 

Even if the court dismisses the complaint based on the 4th Circuit precedent, that does not necessarily mean the claim was baseless. Parker might have a nonfrivolous argument for modifying or reversing that precedent. For example, she might rely on contrary decisions from federal courts in other circuits, holding that short-term rental properties are "goods or services" under the statute. If so, the court should not impose sanctions. However, if Parker can offer no non-frivolous argument for distinguishing, modifying, or reversing the 4th Circuit precedent, she will be subject to sanctions under both Rule 11(b)(2), for asserting a claim with no legal basis, and Rule 11(b)(1), for filing a complaint for an improper purpose (since there is no proper purpose for asserting a frivolous claim).

## Question 2

_Regardless of your answer to the previous question, assume that the court denies Dixon’s motions, holding that the 4th Circuit precedent is distinguishable and does not control Parker’s claim._

Dixon answers the complaint. He also asserts a counterclaim against Parker for defamation (a claim arising under state law), alleging that Parker’s negative review caused a decrease in rentals of his beach house, resulting in lost income.

Does the court have subject matter jurisdiction over the counterclaim?

### Model Answer 

_Rule:_ 28 U.S.C. § 1367 

_Explanation:_ Dixon's counterclaim arises under state law, so the court will not have federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Because Dixon and Parker are both citizens of North Carolina, the court will not have diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (regardless of the amount in controversy). So the only possible basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction is supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367. 

Supplemental jurisdiction will be allowed only if Dixon's counterclaim is "so related to" Parker's claim "that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III". § 1367(a). This is likely satisfied here. The claims share a "common nucleus of operative fact": both arise from the reservation that Parker made for Dixon's rental property, and both involve facts about the condition of that property when Parker arrived. Parker left the allegedly defamatory review on the EZStay website, specifically in response to the denial of her request for a refund. 

In this case, the court has original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, because Parker's claim arises under a federal statute. Consequently, the limitations on supplemental jurisdiction under § 1367(b) do not apply. Assuming the court finds that the two claims are sufficiently related to satisfy § 1331(a), it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Dixon's counterclaim. 

## Question 3

Based on numerous negative reviews and complaints (including Parker’s), EZStay removed Dixon’s beach house from the site. Dixon contends that he has lost rental income as a result. He wants to sue EZStay under the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA).

May Dixon join EZStay as an additional party in Parker’s suit to assert the UDTPA claim?

### Model Answer 

_Rule:_ FRCP Rules 14 & 20

_Explanation:_ Rule 14(a) permits a defendant to join a third-party defendant to assert a claim for contribution or indemnification on the plaintiff's underlying claim. Here, Dixon wants to join EZStay to assert a claim for the income he allegedly lost after EZStay removed the listing for Dixon's property. This is not a claim for contribution or indemnification on Parker's claim against Dixon, and thus not a proper basis for joinder under Rule 14(a). 

However, if Dixon asserts the defamation counterclaim against Parker (see Question 2), he may join EZStay as a co-defendant under Rule 20(a)(2) to assert the UDTPA claim. See Rule 13(h) ("Rules 19 and 20 govern the addition of a person as a party to a counterclaim or crossclaim.") Dixon's claims against both Parker and EZStay would arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, or series thereof: i.e. Parker's negative review and EZStay's consequent removal of the listing for Dixon's property. Those claims would involve at least some common questions of fact, i.e. whether the statements in Parker's review about Dixon and his property were false (which would be an element of the defamation claim against Parker and also likely relevant to the claim against EZStay). 

## Question 4

_Regardless of your answer to the previous question, assume Dixon does not join EZStay as an additional party. _

In the course of discovery, Parker learns that Dixon had contacted EZStay claiming that Parker’s review was defamatory and asking them to reconsider the removal of his beach house from the site. In response, EZStay deleted the review and banned Parker from renting properties through the site. Parker wants to amend her complaint to add a claim against Dixon for tortious interference (a state law claim alleging that the defendant intentionally and wrongfully interfered with the plaintiff’s contractual or business relationships). The statute of limitations on that claim ran out a month after Parker filed her original complaint against Dixon.

If Dixon objects, should the court allow Parker to amend her complaint?

### Model Answer 

_Rule:_ FRCP Rule 15 

_Explanation:_ Assuming the time for amending as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)(1) has passed, Parker must either obtain Dixon's consent or leave of the court to amend, Rule 15(a)(2). The court will grant leave to amend, unless Dixon can show undue prejudice, bad faith, or futility. There are no facts here to suggest bad faith or undue prejudice. Parker seeks to amend based on newly discovered facts, and Dixon will presumably have an opportunity to obtain additional discovery relevant to the new claim. Dixon's best argument would be that the amendment is futile, because the new claim is barred by the statute of limitations. This depends on whether the amended complaint "asserts a claim … that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading", in which case it will relate back to the original filing (when the new claim would have been timely). Rule 15(c)(1)(B). 

Dixon will argue that Parker's original claim and the new claim arise out of separate and distinct conduct, transactions, and occurrences: the original claim arose out of the denial of Parker's request to cancel her reservation and receive a refund, while the new claim arises from Dixon's allegedly inducing EZStay to delete Parker's negative review and ban her from the site. The claims turn on different sets of facts, involving different alleged harm, resulting from different conduct, occurring at different times. If the court accepts this view, it should deny leave to amend on grounds of futility, since the new claim would be barred by the statute of limitations. 

Parker will argue that both claims arise from the same connected sequence of events: she posted the negative review in response to the denial of her refund request, Dixon in turn responded by asking EZStay to remove the review, and EZStay then acted on Dixon's request and banned Parker from using the site. While the claims involve different legal issues, there is significant factual overlap, i.e. facts about the condition of the rental property and the denial of Parker's refund request. These facts tie together the original claim, which turns on whether the rental property was not fit for its ordinary and intended purpose, and the new claim, which turns on whether Dixon wrongfully retaliated against Parker by inducing EZStay to remove Parker's review and ban her from the site. If the court accepts this view, it should grant leave to amend, since the new claim will relate back to the original filing.
