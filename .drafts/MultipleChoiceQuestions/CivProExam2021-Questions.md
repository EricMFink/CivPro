# Question 1

The United Novelty & Explosive Workers Union ("Union") represents employees at Acme Corp., pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act ("NLRA", a federal statute). A collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") between the Union and Acme governs the terms and conditions of employment for Acme employees. The CBA provides that any disputes arising under the CBA must be resolved through a contractual grievance procedure, culminating in binding arbitration between the Union (representing the interests of the employee initiating the grievance) and Acme. Arbitration is the exclusive remedy for any alleged breaches of the CBA, i.e. neither the Union nor the employee may bring a civil lawsuit over such a dispute. But the grievance and arbitration procedure does not apply to claims based on federal or state statutes.

The CBA also provides that Acme may not discharge an employee without good cause. An employee who believes they have been fired without good cause may ask the Union to pursue a grievance on their behalf. The arbitrator's jurisdiction is limited to disputes based on the CBA itself. If the arbitrator finds that the employee was fired without good cause, the exclusive remedy is reinstatement with back pay.

Wilma Wolf, an Acme employee represented by the Union, was fired for allegedly falsifying her time records. Wolf denied falsifying the time records and initiated a grievance, which the Union took to arbitration. In accordance with the CBA, Wolf was suspended without pay, pending the outcome of the arbitration.

At the arbitration hearing (similar to a trial before a judge, but with more relaxed procedures and without the extensive discovery available in a civil suit), Acme and the Union introduced evidence regarding the alleged falsification of Wolf's time records. The arbitrator found that Wolf did not falsify the time records, and that there was not good cause for discharge as required under the CBA. Accordingly, the arbitrator sustained the grievance and ordered Acme to reinstate Wolf to her former position with back pay for the period of her suspension. Acme sought judicial review in federal court, which affirmed the arbitrator's decision. Under the applicable law, an arbitration decision may have claim and issue preclusive effect if it is affirmed by a court.

Wolf then filed a lawsuit against Acme in federal court, asserting an employment discrimination claim under Title VII ("FLSA", a federal statute). In her complaint, Wolf alleges that the real reason she was fired was in retaliation for complaining about sexual harassment by her supervisor at Acme (something that was not raised in the arbitration). Wolf seeks compensatory and punitive damages, as provided under the Title VII.

_Is Wolf's lawsuit barred by claim preclusion based on the arbitration decision?_

# Question 2

Regardless of your answer to the previous question, assume that Wolf's lawsuit is not barred by claim preclusion.

In its answer to Wolf's complaint, Acme denies that Wolf ever complained about sexual harassment and asserts that Wolf was fired for falsifying her time records (which, if true, would be a defense to the Title VII claim).

_Does issue preclusion apply to the issue of whether Wolf falsified her time records?_


# Question 3

Carl Carpenter (a citizen of NC) enjoys furniture making as a hobby. He orders some exotic wood from Tennessee Timber (a business incorporated and based in TN) for a new project. Tennessee Timber's standard form sales contract includes the following forum selection clause:

> Any suit involving this Agreement and/or any claims or disputes relating to the agreements and transactions between the parties shall be brought in either (i) the Circuit Court of Knox County in the State of Tennessee or (ii) the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, and the buyer hereby submits to the jurisdiction and venue of that Court.

When the shipment arrived at his home, Carl was horrified to discover that the wood was infested with termites. He was even more horrified when the termites spread through his home, causing $100,000 worth of damage.

Carl files suit against Tennessee Timber in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, asserting claims for breach of contract and breach of warranty under state law (assume that the federal court has jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship and do not discuss that issue). Tennessee Timber moves for a change of venue to the Eastern District of Tennessee, based on the forum selection clause in the sales contract. Carl opposes the motion, arguing that the forum selection clause is unenforceable under state law.

The standard for determining whether a contractual choice of forum clause in a consumer contract is different under state and federal law. In this case, if state law applies, the forum selection clause would likely be held unenforceable and the court would thus deny the motion for a change of venue. But if federal law applies, the clause will almost certainly be held enforceable and the court would thus grant the motion for a change of venue.

_Should the court apply state or federal law in deciding whether to enforce the forum selection clause?_
