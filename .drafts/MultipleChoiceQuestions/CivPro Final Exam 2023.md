# Case Scenario

### The following facts apply to all questions in this exam: 

The American Cricket Association (“ACA”) is a professional sports league established two years ago. Walter Wicket, a venture capitalist and cricket fanatic, founded the ACA and is the President and CEO. 

The ACA will hold its inaugural season in the summer of 2024, with eight teams scheduled to compete. To ensure that every team has a home field suitable for professional-level cricket, the ACA is developing new cricket grounds in each city. The ACA will own those facilities and lease them to the teams. 

The Gate City Googlies, based in Greensboro, North Carolina, are one of the teams in the ACA. In November 2022, the ACA entered into a contract with George Penny to buy Penny's 70 acre farm in Greensboro as a site for the Googlies cricket ground. Last week, Penny filed a suit against the ACA and Wicket in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The complaint (see below) alleges that the ACA breached the contract by failing to close on the sale, and seeks to hold Wicket personally liable for the alleged breach.

{Caption and Statement of Jurisdiction omitted}


#### Factual Background

5\. Plaintiff George Penny is the owner of a 70 acre parcel of real property known as "Penny's Farm", located in Greensboro, North Carolina.

6\. In September 2022, Penny received a telephone call from Defendant Walter Wicket, who introduced himself as President and CEO of the American Cricket Association ("ACA"). Wicket explained that the ACA was interested in buying Penny's Farm for commercial development, including a sports field and spectator pavilion.  Between September and November 2022, Penny and Wicket communicated, by telephone and electronic mail, to negotiate terms for the sale of Penny's Farm. 

7\. On November 15, 2022, Penny and the ACA entered into an Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Land ("Agreement"), under which the ACA was to buy Penny's Farm for $1,500,000. 

8\. Section 1(a) of the Agreement defines the "Contract Date" as "the date on which the Agreement has been signed by both parties." On November 15, 2022, Wicket signed the Agreement on behalf of the ACA and Penny signed the Agreement on his own behalf.

9\. Section 1(b) of the Agreement defines the "Closing Date" for the sale as "30 days after the Examination Period ends, upon approval from the city." 

10\. Section 1(c) of the Agreement defines the “Examination Period” as "the period beginning on the first day after the Contract Date and extending until 90 business days after the Contract Date." Section 1(c) further provides that "Buyer may extend the Examination Period by 30 business days, up to three times, upon payment of an additional $2500, non-refundable, for each extension.”

11\. Under the terms of the Agreement, the latest possible ending date of the Examination Period, assuming Defendants used and paid for all three extensions, was August 9, 2023 (180 business days from the Closing Date of November 15, 2022) and the latest possible Closing Date (again assuming Defendants used and paid for all three extensions) was September 21, 2023 (30 business days after August 9, 2023). 

12\. Despite using all three allowable extensions of the Examination Period, Defendants never made any of the required $2500 payments.

13\. On September 15, 2023, the ACA and Penny entered into an "Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement" ("Amendment"). The Amendment modified Section 1(b) of the Agreement to define the Closing Date as "Thirty (30) days after Buyer obtains all Governmental Permits, including but not limited to approval by the City of a Master Site Plan and Building Construction Plans that are required to build the Commercial Development and Sports Field on the property."  

14\. Upon information and belief, the Amendment was drafted by Defendants or their agent.  At the time of the Amendment, Defendants were represented by a licensed real estate agent, but Penny was not. Upon information and belief, Wicket is experienced in commercial real estate transactions and development. Penny is a farmer and had no prior experience in commercial real estate transactions or the process required for commercial real estate development. 

15\. Defendants used their superior knowledge of commercial real estate and bargaining power to cause Penny to enter into the Amendment in an unfair and deceptive manner. 

16\. The Amendment defines the Closing Date in a manner that makes it impossible to determine when the Closing Date will be. Upon information and belief, Defendants used this deliberately vague and ambiguous language to bind Penny indefinitely, without binding Defendants at all. 

17\. The Amendment is void and unenforceable as a matter of law, because its terms are hopelessly vague and ambiguous, because it was unsupported by additional consideration, and because Defendants used unfair and deceptive means to induce Penny to sign the Amendment. 

18\. Because the Amendment is void and unenforceable, Defendants were contractually obligated to close on the transaction and pay the agreed-upon purchase price no later than September 21, 2023. 

19\. Penny has received no communication from Defendants since September 15, 2023. 

20\. On November 17, 2023, Penny, through his legal counsel, notified Defendants in writing that the Agreement was terminated as a result of the failure to close on the sale within the contractually-allotted time. On November 20, 2023, Defendants' legal counsel responded, stating that Defendants did not consider the Agreement to be terminated and that they intended to require Penny to go through with the sale. 

#### Count I

#### Breach of Contract

21\. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates the allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully set forth herein.

22\. The ACA breached the Agreement by failing to close within the time allowed under the Agreement or within a commercially reasonable time under the circumstances. 

23\. Plaintiff has been damaged as a result of the ACA's material breach of contract. 

#### Count II

#### Piercing the Corporate Veil

24\. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates the allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 23 as if fully set forth herein.

25\. Upon information and belief, Wicket operates the ACA as a mere instrumentality or alter ego of himself, exercising complete dominion and control over the ACA. Upon information and belief, Wicket controlled the conduct of the ACA with regard to the acts and omissions described herein to such an extent that the ACA had no separate mind, will, or existence of its own. 

26\. Wicket's use of his control over the ACA to violate Plaintiff's legal rights was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's damages. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that the Court grant the following relief: 

1\. A judgment against Defendants for breach of contract and an award of damages in an amount exceeding $75,000;

2\. A judgment piercing the corporate veil and holding Wicket personally liable for the acts and omissions of the ACA. 

3\. Such other relief as the Court deems necessary and proper.

# Part A: Essay 

### For purposes of this question, assume that the court has personal jurisdiction over each defendant and subject matter jurisdiction over each claim.

In response to the complaint, Wicket files a motion under FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss the claim seeking to hold him personally liable for the alleged breach of contract. 

Ordinarily, corporate shareholders are not personally liable for a breach of contract by the corporation. However, where "the corporation is so operated that it is a mere instrumentality or alter ego of the sole or dominant shareholder and a shield for his activities in violation of law", the equitable remedy of "piercing the corporate veil" allows a plaintiff to hold the shareholder personally liable for the corporation's breach. "Veil piercing" requires more than just majority or complete ownership of the corporation's stock. The plaintiff must show that the shareholder "exercises complete domination, not only of finances, but of policy and business practice in respect to the transaction attacked so that the corporate entity as to this transaction had at the time no separate mind, will or existence of its own." Relevant factors include: 

- Disregard of corporate formalities, such as failing to file annual reports with the state, failing to keep corporate records, or making corporate decisions without involvement or approval by the board of directors;
- Intentional undercapitalization (providing the corporation with inadequate assets) or siphoning (transferring assets out of the corporation) that leaves the corporation unable to pay operating expenses, debts, and liabilities;
- Failure to respect the separate personality of the corporation, such as commingling of corporate and personal funds, or personal use of corporate property.

Should the court dismiss the "Veil Piercing" claim against Wicket? (Assume that the breach of contract claim against the ACA would withstand a motion to dismiss and do not address that issue.)

# Part B: Multiple Choice

### Regardless of your answer to Question 1, assume that Wicket does not file a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).

## Question 2

George Penny was born on his family's farm in Greensboro, North Carolina and has lived there his entire life. 

Walter Wicket resides in California, where he was born and raised. Wicket also owns a house in Asheville, North Carolina. He spends at least a month there every year and plans to live there permanently after he retires. 

Wicket founded the ACA two years ago. The ACA is organized as a business corporation under Delaware law, and has its business headquarters in San Jose, California. Wicket owns 60% of the ACA's corporate stock and is chair of the board of directors. The remaining stock is owned by the eight teams that have joined the ACA for its inaugural season (5% each) and each team has a seat on the board of directors. 

Does the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction over Penny's claims?

a. Yes, the court has diversity jurisdiction. 

b. Yes, if the ACA and Wicket assert a defense based on federal law. 

c. No, because Wicket owns a home in North Carolina. 

d. No, because the Gate City Googlies are shareholders in the ACA and have a seat on the ACA's board of directors. 


### Regardless of your answer to the previous question, for purposes of the remaining questions, assume that the court has subject matter jurisdiction over Penny's claims against the ACA and Wicket.

## Question 3

Under state law, a plaintiff suing a corporation may not join a shareholder as a co-defendant to pursue the veil piercing remedy in the same action. Instead, the plaintiff must first sue and obtain a judgment against the corporation. If the plaintiff is unable to collect on the judgment from the corporation, the plaintiff may then bring an action against the shareholder to pursue the veil piercing remedy. Under federal law, FRCP Rule 20(a)(2) allows the plaintiff to join the corporation and shareholder as co-defendants in the same action and the court may then order separate trials or other appropriate measures under Rule 20(b). 

Under both state and federal law, the veil piercing remedy requires proof that the shareholder exercises complete domination over the corporation's finances, policy, and business practices so that the corporate entity is merely an instrumentality or alter ego of the shareholder. Under state law, the ordinary standard of proof---preponderance of evidence---applies to the veil piercing remedy. But under federal law, a heightened standard of proof---clear and convincing evidence---applies to the veil piercing remedy. 


Which of the following is correct? 

a. Federal law will apply to both the joinder of Wicket as a co-defendant and the standard of proof for the veil piercing remedy. 

b. Federal law will apply to the joinder of Wicket as a co-defendant and state law will apply to the standard of proof for the veil piercing remedy. 

c. State  law will apply to both the joinder of Wicket as a co-defendant and the standard of proof for the veil piercing remedy. 

d. State law will apply to the joinder of Wicket as a co-defendant and federal law will apply to the standard of proof for the veil piercing remedy. 

## Question 4

Wicket files an answer, generally denying all allegations in Penny's complaint. Wicket also asserts a counterclaim against Penny for defamation, alleging that Penny was responsible for an anonymous post to a Facebook group called "Greensboro Property Owners" saying, "If Walter Wicket approaches you about buying your property for a cricket field, DO NOT TRUST HIM!!!! He is a liar and a crook who will use every dishonest trick in the book to cheat you." Wicket has no direct evidence that Penny was responsible for the post, but believes he was because Wicket hadn't communicated or dealt with anyone else in Greensboro about acquiring land for the Googlies cricket ground. 

Is Wicket subject to sanctions under Rule 11?

a. Yes, for denying all of Penny's allegations and for asserting the defamation counterclaim without being certain Penny was responsible for the Facebook post. 

b. Yes, but only for denying all of Penny's allegations. 

c. Yes, but only for asserting the defamation counterclaim without being certain Penny was responsible for the Facebook post. 

d. No. 

## Question 5

The ACA files an answer denying that it breached the Agreement. In its answer, the ACA asserts that the Amendment was valid and that even under the original terms of the Agreement, it was not required to close on the sale until 30 days after it obtained the requisite government approval and permits. In addition, the ACA asserts a counterclaim against Penny for breach of contract, contending that he terminated the Agreement without cause. 

Assume that, under state law, the Gate City Googlies would also have standing to assert a breach of contract claim against Penny, because the purpose of the Agreement was to acquire property on which to build a cricket ground for use by the team.  

May the Googlies join as a co-party with the ACA on its counterclaim and (assuming joinder would be allowed) would the court have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim by the Googlies against Penny?

a. The Googlies may join as a co-party with the ACA against Penny, but the court would not have subject matter jurisdiction unless the Googlies could recover more than $75,000 from Penny. 
 
b. The Googlies may join as a co-party with the ACA against Penny, and the court would have subject matter jurisdiction regardless of how much the Googlies could recover from Penny. 

c. The Googlies may join as a co-party with the ACA against Penny, but the court would not have subject matter jurisdiction regardless of how much the Googlies could recover from Penny. 

d. The Googlies may not join as a co-party with the ACA against Penny, but the court would have subject matter jurisdiction over their claim. 

## Question 6

The ACA also wants to assert two claims against Wicket: (1) a claim that Wicket breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation by negotiating and signing the Agreement without authorization or approval by the board of directors, (2) a claim that Wicket embezzled $25,000 in corporate funds, unrelated to the Agreement with Penny.

Which of the following is correct?

a. Under the FRCP, joinder of the fiduciary duty claim is compulsory and joinder of the embezzlement claim is permitted.

b. Under the FRCP, joinder of the fiduciary duty claim is permitted, and joinder of the embezzlement claim is permitted regardless of whether the ACA also asserts the fiduciary duty claim. 

c. Under the FRCP, joinder of the fiduciary duty claim is permitted, and joinder of the embezzlement claim is permitted only if the ACA also asserts the fiduciary duty claim. 

d. Under the FRCP, neither joinder of the fiduciary duty claim nor joinder of the embezzlement claim is permitted. 

## Question 7

_Regardless of your answer to the previous question, assume that the FRCP would permit joinder of both claims by the ACA against Wicket._ 

If the ACA asserts both claims against Wicket, which of the following is correct?

a. The court will have subject matter jurisdiction over both claims, provided the amount in controversy between the ACA and Wicket exceeds $75,000. 

b. The court will have subject matter jurisdiction over both claims, regardless of the amount in controversy between the ACA and Wicket. 

c. The court will have subject matter jurisdiction over the fiduciary duty claim, but will not have subject matter jurisdiction over the embezzlement claim. 

d. The court will not have subject matter jurisdiction over either claim.

## Question 8

_Regardless of your answer to the previous question, assume that the ACA does not assert any claim against Wicket in Penny's suit._

The case proceeds to discovery, at the conclusion of which Wicket moves for summary judgment on the "Veil Piercing" claim. In support of his motion, Wicket offers an affidavit in which he declares that the ACA consistently filed annual reports with the State of California, maintained appropriate business records, and observed all other corporate formalities; that the board of directors reviewed and approved all corporate decisions, including the Agreement with Penny; that the corporation had adequate cash and other assets to pay all anticipated expenses and debts; and that he never commingled the ACA's corporate funds with his own or made personal use of corporate property. 

Should the court grant the motion for summary judgment? 

a. No, because Wicket may not rely solely on his self-serving affidavit and is required to offer additional evidence to refute the claim that he operated the ACA as his mere instrumentality or alter ego. 

b. No, if the court believes that Penny may be able to produce evidence at trial proving that Wicket operated the ACA as his mere instrumentality or alter ego. 

c. Yes, if the court determines that Wicket's affidavit is credible.

d. Yes, unless Penny supports his opposition to the motion with evidence showing that Wicket operated the ACA as his mere instrumentality or alter ego.

## Question 9

_Regardless of your answer to the previous question, assume that the court grants Wicket's motion for summary judgment and dismisses the claim against him._

Along with its order granting Wicket's motion for summary judgment, the court issues a written decision that contains these findings of fact and conclusions of law: 

- The ACA board of directors authorized Wicket to negotiate an agreement to buy the Plaintiff's property. The board of directors also reviewed the Agreement, approved the terms, and authorized Wicket to sign the Agreement on behalf of the corporation. 
- In his dealings with Penny, Wicket acted at all times within the scope of his authority as an agent of, and consistent with his fiduciary duties to, the ACA. 

The suit proceeded on the remaining claims between Penny and the ACA.  After a bench trial, the court entered judgment in favor of Penny on both his claim and the ACA's counterclaim. The court again issued a written decision that included these findings of fact and conclusions of law: 

- The ACA made the 3 payments of $7500 for extending the Examination Period, 
- The ACA failed to exercise due diligence in obtaining the required building permits.
- The terms of the Amendment are so vague and ambiguous as to render the Amendment unenforceable and void. 
- The ACA failed to close on the sale within a commercially reasonable time.
- By failing to exercise due diligence and failing to close on the sale within a commercially reasonable time, the ACA breached the Agreement. 
- When Penny notified the defendants that he was terminating the Agreement, the ACA was already in material breach and the Agreement was no longer enforceable by the ACA against Penny. 

The court awarded Penny $1.5 million (the sale price under the Agreement) in damages against the ACA. 

Furious over this debacle, the eight ACA teams bring a shareholder derivative suit against Wicket. In this type of suit, the shareholders sue in a representative capacity on behalf of the corporation, to assert claims against corporate officers or directors for breach of their duty to the corporation. 

The complaint alleges that Wicket exceeded his authority as an agent of the ACA and breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation, by negotiating and signing the Agreement without authorization or approval by the board of directors, and that the ACA lost Penny's lawsuit as a result of Wicket's fiduciary breach. 

Wicket files an answer denying liability. He then files a motion for summary judgment, asserting (1) that the claim is barred by the judgment in the prior suit, and (2) if the claim is not barred, the plaintiffs are precluded from disputing the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law in the prior suit. 

Which of the following is correct? 

a. Claim preclusion and issue preclusion will both apply against the plaintiffs.

b. Neither claim preclusion or issue preclusion will apply against the plaintiffs. 

c. Claim preclusion will apply against the plaintiffs, but issue preclusion will not. 

d. Issue preclusion will apply against the plaintiffs, but claim preclusion will not.

## Question 10

In the aftermath of Penny's suit, the ACA is unable to acquire an alternate site and build a cricket ground for the Gate City Googlies in time for the 2024 season. The Googlies file a lawsuit against the ACA in North Carolina state court. The complaint alleges that the ACA breached its contractual duty to provide the team with a suitable home field, and that the team had to refund $50,000 in advance ticket sales as a result. 

The ACA moves to dismiss the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction. Should the court grant the motion? 

a. Yes, unless the ACA owns some property in North Carolina and the plaintiff has the court attach that property to secure payment of any eventual judgment. 

b. Yes, because the ACA is not incorporated in North Carolina and does not have its principal place of business there. 

c. No, because the ACA waived any object to personal jurisdiction in North Carolina by failing to raise that objection in Penny's suit. 

d. No, because the ACA established a business relationship with the Googlies and promised to build a cricket ground for the team in North Carolina, for the purpose of hosting league matches there. 


## Question 11

_Regardless of your answer to the previous question, assume that the ACA does not move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction._

The Googlies' complaint against the ACA alleges that "The purchase of a site for the Googlies cricket ground fell through because the ACA and its agent, Walter Wicket, failed to exercise due diligence in obtaining required building permits." The ACA files an answer, specifically denying that allegation (among others) and contends that "The ACA and Wicket made their best efforts to obtain the requisite building permits and close on the purchase of Penny's Farm in time to build a cricket ground on that site. The ACA was unable to acquire the site only because Penny terminated the Agreement without cause."

The ACA files a motion to dismiss under FRCP Rule 12(b)(7) for failure to join a party required to be joined if feasible. The ACA contends that Wicket is a party who must be joined if feasible, because the team is seeking to hold the ACA liable based on Wicket's actions. But the ACA contends that joinder of Wicket is not feasible. 

Which of the following is correct? 

a. Wicket is a party who must be joined if feasible, and joinder of Wicket is feasible. 

b. Wicket is a party who must be joined if feasible, but joinder of Wicket is not feasible. 

c. Joinder of Wicket is feasible, but Wicket is not a party who must be joined if feasible. 

d. Joinder of Wicket is not feasible, and Wicket is not a party who must be joined if feasible.
