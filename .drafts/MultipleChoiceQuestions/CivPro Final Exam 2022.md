# Multiple Choice 

_The following facts apply to all question in Part II:_

Parker (a citizen of North Carolina) rented a beach house in North Carolina from Dixon (a citizen of North Carolina) through an online service, EZStay (incorporated and having its principal place of business in California). When Parker made the reservation, she paid the rental fee in full, as required by EZStay’s terms of service. Upon arriving at the beach house, Parker was horrified to discover that it was infested with ants that were feasting on food scraps and dirty dishes left in the kitchen and living room. Parker immediately went to the EZStay website to cancel the reservation and request a refund of the rental fee, but the request was denied. Unwilling to spend her vacation in such disgusting conditions, Parker instead checked into a hotel, where she enjoyed a pleasant and ant-free stay, but at twice the cost of Dixon’s rental house. After returning home, Parker left a review on the EZStay website, giving Dixon 0 out of 5 stars, and saying “I wouldn’t let my worst enemy stay at this beach house. It’s in disgusting condition and the owner is an unscrupulous jerk!”

Parker sues Dixon in federal court, asserting a claim under the Truth in E-Commerce Act, a federal statute. The Act requires all goods and services sold or rented online to be fit for the ordinary and intended purpose for which they are sold or leased, and allows a consumer to sue the seller or lessor if goods or services purchased or leased online are not fit for their ordinary and intended purpose.

In each of the following questions, assume that the court has personal jurisdiction over all parties and do not address that issue. 

## Question 1

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit (which includes the federal courts in North Carolina) has held that short-term rental properties are not “goods or services” within the meaning of the Truth in E-Commerce Act. Dixon files a motion to dismiss Parker’s complaint, asserting that under the controlling 4th Circuit precedent, Parker’s complaint does not state a valid claim under the Truth in E-Commerce Act. Dixon also moves for sanctions against Parker and her attorney, arguing that the claim has no legal basis and was filed for the improper purpose of trying to pressure Dixon to give Parker a refund.

Assuming the court agrees that, under the 4th Circuit precedent, it must dismiss the complaint, should the court also impose sanctions on Parker and/or her attorney?

## Question 2

_Regardless of your answer to the previous question, assume that the court denies Dixon’s motions, holding that the 4th Circuit precedent is distinguishable and does not control Parker’s claim._

Dixon answers the complaint. He also asserts a counterclaim against Parker for defamation (a claim arising under state law), alleging that Parker’s negative review caused a decrease in rentals of his beach house, resulting in lost income.

Does the court have subject matter jurisdiction over the counterclaim?

Explanation:

## Question 3

Based on numerous negative reviews and complaints (including Parker’s), EZStay removed Dixon’s beach house from the site. Dixon contends that he has lost rental income as a result. He wants to sue EZStay under the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA).

May Dixon join EZStay as an additional party in Parker’s suit to assert the UDTPA claim?

Rule:

Explanation:

## Question 4

_Regardless of your answer to the previous question, assume Dixon does not join EZStay as an additional party. _

In the course of discovery, Parker learns that Dixon had contacted EZStay claiming that Parker’s review was defamatory and asking them to reconsider the removal of his beach house from the site. In response, EZStay deleted the review and banned Parker from renting properties through the site. Parker wants to amend her complaint to add a claim against Dixon for tortious interference (a state law claim alleging that the defendant intentionally and wrongfully interfered with the plaintiff’s contractual or business relationships). The statute of limitations on Parker’s UDTPA claim ran out a month after she filed her original complaint against Dixon.

If Dixon objects, should the court allow Parker to amend her complaint?
