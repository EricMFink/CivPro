### Elden v. Nirvana, L.L.C., No. CV 21-6836 FMO (AGRx) (C.D.Cal. Sept. 30, 2025)

#### Background

In 1991, Spencer Elden, then a four-month-old infant, was photographed naked in a pool for the cover of Nirvana's "Nevermind" music album. The album cover depicted plaintiff underwater, "grabbing for a dollar bill" on a fishook that had been superimposed onto the photograph. The "Nevermind" album was released in September 1991, and was widely distributed commercially, becoming "a platinum record only months after its release." 

Plaintiff filed the instant action nearly 30 years after the album's release. Plaintiff brings a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255(a), which provides a civil remedy for individuals who were victims of certain enumerated crimes while they were minors. Plaintiff alleges that "Nirvana's Nevermind album cover constitutes commercial child pornography," and that defendants have engaged in "ongoing violations" of multiple provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A—a criminal statute penalizing certain activities relating to child pornography—because they "knowingly possessed, transported, reproduced, advertised, promoted, presented, distributed, provided, and/or obtained" the album cover. According to plaintiff, the continued use of the image on the album cover has "caused, and continues to cause, him serious injury including, without limitation, physical, psychological, financial, and reputational damages." Plaintiff seeks "to recover for injuries ... sustained during the ten years preceding the filing of this action, and injuries he has sustained since then." He requests either actual damages or statutory liquidated damages in the amount of $150,000, punitive damages, and equitable relief, including "an injunction against future sales, marketing or distribution" and "prohibiting the Defendants from continuing to engage in the injurious acts." 

#### Statement of Facts

In 1991, plaintiff, then a four-month-old infant, was photographed naked in a pool for the cover of Nirvana's "Nevermind" record album. The album cover depicts a naked baby (plaintiff) floating underwater as he appears to reach for a dollar bill on a fishhook.

The circumstances of the album cover's creation are largely undisputed. At the time, Nirvana had been signed to a small, independent record label for years, but in 1991, the band signed with a major label—Geffen Records—that represented several major artists. In advance of the album's release, the band worked with a Geffen art director, Robert Fisher, to develop the artwork for the album cover. The band initially floated the idea of an underwater childbirth and after looking for images, Fisher showed the band a stock photo of a baby swimming underwater in a pool, which the band liked. Because the stock image was prohibitively expensive, Geffen hired photographer Kirk Weddle, who specialized in underwater photography, to recreate the image. 

Weddle asked his close friends, Rick and Renata Elden, whether they were interested in having their infant son participate in an underwater photo shoot for an album cover. Plaintiff's parents agreed.

The photo shoot took place at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center, a public pool. Weddle, plaintiff, plaintiff's parents, Weddle's assistant, and the lifeguard on duty were present. During the photo shoot, plaintiff's parents were in the pool with plaintiff; one parent released him into the water for a few seconds while Weddle took photographs, and the other parent took plaintiff out of the water, and passed him back. Weddle photographed plaintiff as he appeared after being released into the pool. 

None of the individuals present expressed any sexual intent during the photo shoot. Plaintiff's parents did not consider the image to be child pornography, and did not ask defendants to change or censor the image. After the photo was taken, a dollar bill and fishook were superimposed onto the image to create the album cover. 

The "Nevermind" album was released in 1991, and as of last year, had sold 40 million copies. Major commercial retailers have sold the album around the world, online and in stores. The album cover has been named one of the greatest album covers of all time, including by Rolling Stone and Billboard. The album cover is part of the New York Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection. Many have interpreted the album cover to represent the tension between art and capitalism. 

The album cover does not identify plaintiff as the infant in the image. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 1992, plaintiff's father identified his son as the "Nirvana baby," and has since frequently discussed his son's participation in the album cover. Over the years, plaintiff has given numerous interviews about the album cover, sold autographed album memorabilia, accepted payment to reenact the album cover, and sent a thank-you postcard—depicting what appears to be a hand-drawn picture of the album cover—to Weddle. 

In 2019 or 2020, plaintiff reported the album cover as potential child pornography to the Federal Bureau of Investigations, but the agency declined to investigate. There is nothing in the record to suggest or indicate that any other law enforcement agency has evaluated the image to determine whether it constitutes child pornography. 

#### Legal Standard

Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the granting of summary judgment "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." The standard for granting a motion for summary judgment is essentially the same as for granting a directed verdict. Judgment must be entered "if, under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." 

The moving party has the initial burden of identifying relevant portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a fact or facts necessary for one or more essential elements of each cause of action upon which the moving party seeks judgment. If the moving party fails to carry its initial burden of production, "the nonmoving party has no obligation to produce anything."

If the moving party has sustained its burden, the burden then shifts to the nonmovant to identify specific facts, drawn from materials in the file, that demonstrate that there is a dispute as to material facts on the elements that the moving party has contested. A factual dispute is material only if it affects the outcome of the litigation and requires a trial to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth. Summary judgment must be granted for the moving party if the nonmoving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." 

In determining whether a triable issue of material fact exists, the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. However, summary judgment cannot be avoided by relying solely on "conclusory allegations in an affidavit." "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position" is insufficient to survive summary judgment; "there must be evidence on which the fact finder could reasonably find for the plaintiff."

#### Discussion

As an initial matter, the court, having carefully reviewed the parties' papers, has serious concerns regarding plaintiff's summary judgment papers. In many instances, plaintiff's briefing failed to comply with the evidentiary requirements for summary judgment motions set forth in Rule 56. For example, plaintiff failed to "cite to relevant evidence to support factual assertions throughout the joint brief" and specifically, "to the exhibit and page number(s) of the evidentiary appendix." Further, when plaintiff does attempt to dispute facts, the evidence plaintiff cites, does not or is otherwise insufficient to establish the presence of a disputed fact. For instance, plaintiff purports to dispute the fact that the album cover "depicts an unclothed baby floating in nondescript blue water and reaching for a dollar bill hanging from a fishhook." But none of the evidence plaintiff cites disputes what the album cover depicts or otherwise establishes the presence of a material issue of fact. [Consider whether the plaintiff might be subject to sanctions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3) for disputing what the photo depicts.]{.aside} Indeed, the vast majority of plaintiff's evidentiary citations in his summary judgment papers are to his SAC. Even though plaintiff's SAC is verified, And although plaintiff argues that his "citations to the Declaration of Robert Fisher within his Second Amended Complaint constitute proper evidence on a summary judgment motion," plaintiff does not cite to any specific portions of the declaration.

Plaintiff's failure to cite evidence, properly dispute facts, or otherwise comply with the applicable rules and court orders complicated and delayed the court's review of the record and the parties' briefing. And because neither the briefing nor the Statement of Undisputed Facts identify properly disputed facts, the court was left to speculate as to why and how certain facts are purportedly disputed. Nevertheless, the court will carefully review the record before the court in the light most favorable to plaintiff and consider whether defendants have met their burden to demonstrate that there are no genuine disputes as to any material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.

To prevail on his § 2255(a) claim, the only claim plaintiff asserts in this case, plaintiff must show that he was a "victim of a violation of" a qualifying criminal statute when he was a minor and "suffered personal injury as a result." See 18 U.S.C. § 2255(a). Plaintiff alleges that defendants violated § 2252A(a), which prohibits, as relevant here, the knowing possession, access with intent to view, mailing, transportation, shipment, distribution, receipt, reproduction for the purpose of distribution, advertisement, promotion, presentation, and solicitation of child pornography. 

Defendants assert that plaintiff cannot make a sufficient showing on a critical element of his claim—that the album cover constitutes child pornography. Defendants argue that because "the image is unequivocally non-sexual, it is not child pornography as a matter of law"—that is, "even viewing the evidence in Plaintiff's favor, no reasonable juror could find the Album Cover is child pornography." Plaintiff responds that because "the parties dispute the material fact of whether the Album Cover constitutes child pornography," the issue must go to a jury. 

The term "child pornography" is defined as "any visual depiction" where "the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct." 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8)(A). "Sexually explicit conduct," in turn, is defined to include a "lascivious exhibition" of a person's "anus, genitals, or pubic area." § 2256(2)(A)(v). "To determine whether a visual depiction of a minor constitutes a 'lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area'"—and thus child pornography—courts look to the six factors outlined in United States v. Dost, 636 F.Supp. 828 (S.D. Cal. 1986). The _Dost_ factors consider:

> (1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area;

> (2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity;

> (3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child;

> (4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;

> (5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity;

> (6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.

Although these factors are the typical "starting point," they "are neither exclusive nor conclusive," and instead serve as "general principles" to guide the analysis. The Ninth Circuit has held that "lascivious" is a "commonsensical term," and that courts may consider any other factors relevant to the case. "The inquiry must be case-specific and based on the overall content of the visual depiction." In other words, the question of whether an image can fairly be considered child pornography demands a holistic, practical, commonsense approach. Although the test for obscenity is stricter and doesn't apply here, child pornography tends to have a similar quality as obscenity—there is an element of "you know it when you see it."

##### A. The _Dost_ factors.

To evaluate the album cover and any purported factual disputes, the court considers the _Dost_ factors in turn. The first and second _Dost_ factors, "whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area," and "whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive," are not truly disputed here. First, the focal point of the album cover is not on the baby's genitalia. The photo captures the baby floating, and the lighting and angle of the photo, as well as the baby's prone position, are such that the focal point of the image is on the baby reaching for the dollar bill. The baby's genitalia are in the background of the image, under a shadow, and comprise a small portion of the overall image—they are not the focal point of the album cover. Although plaintiff asserts that "the focal point of the picture is on his genitals and the photographer positioned the camera to make plaintiff's genitals appear enlarged," In other words, neither the image itself nor anything else in the record suggests this is true. 

Second, the baby is not "in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity." Plaintiff argues that "the setting of the picture is sexually suggestive" because the baby is underwater, "unable to breathe," and "appears grasping for a dollar like a sex worker." But viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the court has a difficult time understanding how this is a reasonable interpretation or inference to be drawn from the image. Further, plaintiff cites no relevant authority to suggest that the public pool, i.e., the underwater setting in this case, is inherently sexually suggestive. Indeed, the setting here is unlike others typically considered to be sexually suggestive. Finally, while it is plain that the baby appears to be reaching for the dollar, a dollar bill is not inherently sexually suggestive, and there is no evidence or basis to conclude that the baby is in "a pose generally associated with sexual activity."

Next, there is no dispute as to the third factor: "whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child." Plaintiff purports to dispute the fact that "Weddle photographed him as he appeared naturally in the pool" and that "Weddle did not pose Plaintiff in any way," Plaintiff also argues that the baby is "depicted fully naked, gagged, and dunked underwater in an unnatural pose," noting that "infants cannot naturally swim, and it is not natural for a four-month-old infant to be submerged underwater." But plaintiff's claim that the baby appears "gagged" is, again, a plainly unreasonable inference. Common sense suggests that floating is a natural pose, and Weddle's undisputed testimony indicates that the baby was floating naturally. Plaintiff has pointed to nothing else in the record to suggest that the baby was posed in an unnatural way. The undisputed evidence indicates that the baby was released into the water for a few seconds, and that Weddle took several images of him as he floated briefly. It is thus undisputed that the baby was not depicted in an unnatural pose. 

The fourth factor, "whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude," is also undisputed. This is the only _Dost_ factor the image satisfies. However, both caselaw and common sense tell us that "not all images of nude children are pornographic," and that innocent depictions of child nudity do not constitute child pornography. For example, a family photo of a nude child bathing would not ordinarily be child pornography.

The fifth factor, "whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity," is inapplicable to toddlers or very young children. Plaintiff nevertheless contends that the album cover suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity because of the "the prurient nature of the picture," and "the juxtaposition of the dollar bill and the open display of plaintiff's genitals for consumption by the viewer." But even if a baby could somehow be considered to exhibit sexual coyness—an incredible proposition—nothing about the image or its context supports plaintiff's contentions and unreasonable inferences.

The sixth factor considers the intent behind the photo—"whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer." Under this factor, the "apparent motive of the photographer" and the "intended response of the viewer are relevant." Such intent has been found when, for instance, the photographer defendant who captures the pertinent photos is sexually interested in children. Here, the undisputed evidence establishes that no individual present at the photo shoot expressed any sexual interest or motive or had any intent to create a sexual response in those who would view the album cover in the future. Plaintiff purports to dispute this fact, but again does not cite any evidence to show how this fact is disputed. 

Additionally, evidence about the ideas behind the album cover suggests that it was intended and understood to embody a critique of the tension between art and capitalism.

Plaintiff's contentions that the album cover image was intended to elicit a sexual response in the viewer, are unpersuasive. None of plaintiff's evidence establishes any connection—and plaintiff makes no attempt to show one—between Kurt Cobain and the creation of the album cover. Indeed, it is undisputed that Kurt Cobain was not present when the album cover image was taken, and plaintiff has failed to establish any connection between Kurt Cobain's diary entries and the album cover. The other evidence plaintiff cites to is similarly tangential and lacks any meaningful connection to the album cover.

In short, having considered all the _Dost_ factors, neither the pose, focal point, setting, nor overall context suggest the album cover features sexually explicit conduct. In other words, other than the fact that plaintiff was nude on the album cover, no other _Dost_ factor comes close to bringing the image within the ambit of the child pornography statute. And when considering plaintiff's nudity in the context of the other _Dost_ factors, all we are left with is the image of a naked baby floating underwater, reaching for a dollar bill. This image—an image that is most analogous to a family photo of a nude child bathing—is plainly insufficient to support a finding of lasciviousness. 

##### B. Other Relevant Factors.

As noted above, the _Dost_ factors "are neither exclusive nor conclusive, and courts may consider any other factor that may be relevant in a particular case." Defendants argue that the court should consider the full context of the album cover's creation and its subsequent distribution in assessing whether the album cover constitutes child pornography. The court agrees.

As defendants note: (1) "both of Plaintiff's parents were at the photo shoot and the photo was taken by their close friend;" (2) the album cover received "broad commercial distribution" unlike the typical distribution methods for child pornography; (3) millions of people purchased the album and thus possess copies of the image (but presumably do not consider the image to be child pornography); and (4) "no law enforcement agency ever investigated the album cover or the individuals involved." Also, plaintiff has, for many years, embraced and financially benefitted from being featured on the album cover. This includes plaintiff being paid to reenact the photo, selling autographed album-related posters and memorabilia, participating in interviews about the album cover, and even referring to himself as the "Nirvana baby." Plaintiff also tattooed the album's name across his chest, Plaintiff's actions relating to the album over time are difficult to square with his contentions that the album cover constitutes child pornography and that he sustained serious damages as a result of the album cover. In short, the foregoing factors are relevant considerations in the overall context of the photo's creation, intended purpose, and subsequent use, and further support the court's finding that the album cover does not constitute child pornography.

#### Conclusion

In sum, there are no disputes of material fact, and the _Dost_ and other relevant factors compel a finding that the album cover is not child pornography. 

Based on the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED THAT:

1. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.

2. Judgment shall be entered dismissing the above-captioned case with prejudice.
